            <h1>hi, my name is André Moecke</h1>
            <p>André Moecke: “Photographer, Addicted Traveler… With a camera and a life in my hands.”
            <p>I’m born and raised in Florianópolis/Brazil and I’m passionate about arts since I was very young.</p>
            <p>I’m graduated in Architecture, but since 2009 I’ve been working with photography, mostly in architectural photography, but also sports, fashion and product photography.</p>
            <p>In 2017 I moved to Munich/Germany, where I started working as a Photo Editor and Photographer for the printed magazines industry, in a new work experience that I hadn’t before: being in a publishing office in a daily basis job. This experience brought me an even more wide vision of the process to build a complex project as a magazine, having the opportunity to work with many different areas as writers, producers, designers, art directors, etc. I worked in this field for 3,5 years for the magazines JOY, SHAPE, Cosmopolitan and MADAME/Monsieur. For one year I worked as a full-time photographer for NordicOil. There I had to opportunity for not only take photos, but create the images from concept, pre production to final retouching, being actively responsible for the entire process of content creation.</p>
            <p>Currently I’m searching for a new opportunity, and using this time to develop and specialise myself in photo editing, retouching and video editing. My last new challange is learn and become a web-developer, what I'm currently working on, creating pages as this one.</p>
